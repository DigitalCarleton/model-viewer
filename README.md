# model-viewer

[model-viewer web component](https://modelviewer.dev) custom modifications


Starting from scene code generated by the model-viewer Editor at [https://modelviewer.dev/editor/](https://modelviewer.dev/editor/), this adds the ability to parse query parameters so that new models and posters placed in a `models/` subdirectory can be loaded via queries following the format 

```?model=model-name```

#Examples

Try it out by loading the included horse or dog models,e.g. 

```mywebsite.com/model/?model=horse```

#Adding new models

To add additional models:

 - upload a model-name.glb file to the Editor
 - download the webp format poster
 - rename poster.webp to model-name.webp
 - place both in the `models/` subdirectory
 - access at ?model=model-name.
